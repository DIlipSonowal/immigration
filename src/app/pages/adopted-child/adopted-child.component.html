                        <p>Have you adopted a child? Want to sponsor him or her as a permanent resident of Canada both you and your child should be eligible to be sponsored.</p>

                        <p>For your child to be eligible for permanent resident status, you must be:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>a Canadian citizen, born or naturalized in Canada or permanent resident, applying on behalf of the adopted child who is under 18 years of age at the time of application;</li>
                            <li>an adopted person who is 18 years of age or older at the time of application, and was adopted by a Canadian citizen, born or naturalized in Canada;</li>
                            <li>a legal guardian applying on behalf of an adopted child under 18 years of age at the time of application if the child had at least one Canadian parent, born or naturalized in Canada, at the time of adoption;</li>
                            <li>a non-Canadian adoptive parent applying on behalf of an adopted child under 18 years of age at the time of application if the other parent is a Canadian citizen, born or naturalized in Canada at the time of the adoption.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>All adoptions must:</h3>

                        <ul>
                            <li>be legal in the child’s home country and in the province or territory where you live;</li>
                            <li>end the legal relationship between your adopted child and his or her biological parents;</li>
                            <li>meet the requirements of your province or territory, including a home study;</li>
                            <li>create a genuine parent–child relationship between you and the child;</li>
                            <li>be in the best interests of the child;</li>
                            <li>not be primarily to gain permanent resident status for the child in Canada.</li>
                        </ul>

                       <p>Adoptions are the responsibility of the provinces and territories in Canada. You should contact your province or territory in Canadafor information on eligibility to adopt and the accompanying requirements that must be met, but first you should read all of the information in this section to know what to expect.</p>
                       <p>Once the adoption process is in progress and you have received a Letter of No Objection from the province or territory, you can apply to sponsor your child. After that, you can apply for a permanent resident visa for your child to come to Canada.</p>
