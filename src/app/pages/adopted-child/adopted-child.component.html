                       <p>Adoptions are the responsibility of the provinces and territories in Canada. You should contact your province or territory in Canadafor information on eligibility to adopt and the accompanying requirements that must be met, but first you should read all of the information in this section to know what to expect.</p>
                       <p>Once the adoption process is in progress and you have received a Letter of No Objection from the province or territory, you can apply to sponsor your child. After that, you can apply for a permanent resident visa for your child to come to Canada.</p>
