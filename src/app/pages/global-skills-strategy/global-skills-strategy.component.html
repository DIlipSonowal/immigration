                        <p>The Global skills strategy is a part of Canada Government’s plan to accelerate the hiring of exceptionally talented global workers by few innovative companies, which would in turn help in their growth and success.</p>
                        <p>As per the global talent stream, work permit applications for these skilled foreign workers need to be processed only within 2 weeks. This program is also a part of the temporary foreign worker program to recruit global talent in a fast way by reducing the visa processing time from 6 months to only 15 days.</p>
                        <p>However, the employees are mandated to create employment for Canadians and transfer knowledge to Canadian workers as a part of the Labour Markets Benefits Plan.</p>
                        <p>Given below are few key features of the strategy:</p>

                        <ol style="list-style: lower-alpha;">

                            <li>Annulation of the work permit requirement for short term high skilled workers and academic stays.</li>
                            <li>Client based service to guide companies through the application process and other details.</li>
                        </ol>
